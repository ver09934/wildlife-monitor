- Make less monolithic and more modular
	- Make the main file simpler, move stuff into other modules
	- Define an abstract class for a dataSensor
	- Define an abstract classs for a general motionSensor
        	- Can then have a dummy that triggers periodically
- Move to an SCP queue, delete files once transferred
        - Attempt to handle failures...
	- Attempt to make the synchronization as modular as the sensor system (can use rsync, the scp queue, etc.)
- Use JSON for config file
	- See pyimgsearch motion detection examples
- Eliminate the lameXMLFormatter, make the move to JSON if possible
- Eliminate videoconvert.sh if possible (it would be better to write this in python as well)
- Improve user setup, make more intuitive
	- Set whether the system takes pictures or videos on motion detect
	- Set which motion and data sensors to use in the config file
		- Could also detect sensors automatically using connected based on i2c addresses
	- Need to add scripts for 
	- Handle errors in config file
	- A sensor test script that uses i2cdetect to determine which hex adresses are active
	- Write a complete setup script (git clone, dependencies, venv, etc) - error handling!
	- In main script, can have array of sensors, array of sensor locks, etc.
- Allow user to specify ssh key to use for rsync/scp/sftp
- Optional CV config in specs files
	- An OpenCV subsection, with more parameters/fields specified within
- Sensor layout:
 	- Array of Sensors, array of corresponding locks
	- Each sensor returns a 3xN array, where N is the number of fields the sensor has
		- Row 1: Name of field
		- Row 2: Value
		- Row 3: Units
	- UPDATE: Will return a list of 1x3 arrays, in true pythonic fashion...
	- Minutely data gets written to JSON file
	- Motion events get written to a log JSON file

TODO: Update README with the multitude of changes that have/will have been made to the system
TODO: Update README to insure that renamed files are correct (- to _, etc.)

Motion sensor architecture:
- Create object
- Need to create some sort of async system that waits on the object for motion_start and motion_stop events to control if the camera is run

TODO:
Camera class passes back a queue that main method pulls events from?
